Requirement : Java 8 (preferred)


Install bazel (two ways of installation)

 a)  Using Bazel custom APT repository (recommended)

            1. Add Bazel distribution URI as a package source (one time setup)

           $ echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt stable jdk1.8" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list
            #the bazel repo deb package URL is added in source list. 
            #If you want to use the JDK 7, please replace jdk1.8 with jdk1.7 and if you want to install the testing version of Bazel, replace stable with testing.

           $ curl https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
            
            
            
            #If you want to use the JDK 7, please replace jdk1.8 with jdk1.7 and if you want to install the testing version of Bazel, replace stable with testing.

            2. Install and update Bazel

            sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bazel
            
            #Once installed, you can upgrade to newer version of Bazel with:

           $ sudo apt-get upgrade bazel
            
    
b)  Install with installer 

         
         1. #before that make sure your system has java 8 using ' java -version ' in terminal else upgrade or install java 8 by using 
          $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

         2. Install required packages.
            $ sudo apt-get install pkg-config zip g++ zlib1g-dev unzip

         3.  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases
          #check for the versions 
          #download it (latest versions preferred . above 0.4.2 is good )
          
         4. 4. Run the installer

            $  chmod +x bazel-<version>-installer-<os>.sh
             #it makes file as executable. change your directory to where the file is downloaded else copy it into your home directory.
            
            $ ./bazel-<version>-installer-<os>.sh --user
 
              #The --user flag installs Bazel to the $HOME/bin directory on your system and sets the .bazelrc path to $HOME/.bazelrc. Use the --help command to see additional installation options.
            
            $ export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"
              # else add it into ~/.bash.rc 
              
              
       To check bazel is installed -> $ bazel version
